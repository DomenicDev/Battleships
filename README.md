# Battleships
Simple game made with jMonkeyEngine!

I want to program a very simple game which we all know as "Battleship". Therefore I use jMonkeyEngine, an engine you can create 3D games with. The programing language I use for this is Java.

I hope you like it and I wish you fun playing this!

Greetings
Domenic
